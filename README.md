# primality
Discover prime numbers without math


The purpose of this program is to demonstrate primality testing while performing the smallest amount of arithmatic possible.  By Leveraging 
substring comparisons, and factorial shortcuts, a number can be determined as prime or composite while only actually performing a modulas 
with prime factorial seven.

Usage:

`bash primality low_number high_number`
